Title: Analyzing COVID-19 Data with Python: A Data Science Approach
Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world. Understanding its spread and effects is crucial for public health. Data analysis plays a vital role in deciphering trends, predicting outbreaks, and formulating strategies. This tutorial demonstrates the use of Python's data science libraries, with a focus on Pandas, to analyze a COVID-19 dataset
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_csv_file.CSV)

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
data.head()
# Check for missing values
missing_values = data.isnull().sum()

# Convert 'Date' column to datetime format
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])

# Handle missing values if any (example: filling missing values with 0)
data.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Display summary of preprocessing
print("Missing Values:", missing_values)
print("Data Types:", data.dtypes)
